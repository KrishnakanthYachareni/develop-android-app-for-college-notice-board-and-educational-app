 <p>A smile costs nothing, but gives much.</p>
 <p>It enriches those who receive, without making poorer those who give.</p>
 <p>It takes a moment, but the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.</p>
 <p>None is so rich or mighty that he can get along without it, and none is so poor, but that he can be made rich by it.</p>
 <p>A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in business, and is the countersign of friendship.</p>
 <p>It brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and it is natureâ€™s best antidote for trouble.</p>
 <p>Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone, until it is given away.</p>
 <p>Some people are too tired to give you a smile;</p>
 <p>Give them one of yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.</p>
