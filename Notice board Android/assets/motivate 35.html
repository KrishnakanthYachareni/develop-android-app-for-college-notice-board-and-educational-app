 <p>Abraham Lincoln never quits.</p>
 <p>Born into poverty, Lincoln was faced with defeat throughout his life. He lost eight elections, twice failed in business and suffered a nervous breakdown.</p>
 <p>He could have quit many times – but he didn’t and because he didn’t quit, he became one of the greatest presidents in the United States history.</p>
 <p>Here is a sketch of Lincoln’s road to the White House:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>1816 His family was forced out of their home. He had to work to support them.</li>
   <li>1818 His mother died.</li>
   <li>1831 Failed in business.</li>
   <li>1832 Ran for state legislature – lost.</li>
   <li>1832 Also lost his job – wanted to go to law school but couldn’t get in.</li>
   <li>1833 Borrowed some money from a friend to begin a business and by the end of the year he was bankrupt. He spent the next 17 years of his life paying off this debt.</li>
   <li>1834 Ran for state legislature again – won.</li>
   <li>1835 Was engaged to be married, sweetheart died and his heart was broken.</li>
   <li>1836 Had a total nervous breakdown and was in bed for six months.</li>
   <li>1838 Sought to become speaker of the state legislature – defeated.</li>
   <li>1840 Sought to become elector – defeated.</li>
   <li>1843 Ran for Congress – lost.</li>
   <li>1846 Ran for Congress again – this time he won – went to Washington and did a good job.</li>
   <li>1848 Ran for re-election to Congress – lost.</li>
   <li>1849 Sought the job of land officer in his home state – rejected.</li>
   <li>1854 Ran for Senate of the United States – lost.</li>
   <li>1856 Sought the Vice-Presidential nomination at his party’s national convention – get less than 100 votes.</li>
