 <p>To let go does not mean to stop caring, it means I can’t do it for someone else.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to cut myself off, it’s the realization that I can’t control another.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to enable, but to allow learning from natural consequences.</p>
 <p>To let go is to admit powerlessness, which means the outcome is not in my hands.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to try to change or blame another, it’s to make the most of myself.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to care for, but to care about.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to fix, but to be supportive.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to judge, but to allow another to be a human being.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to be in the middle arranging all the outcomes, but to allow others to affect their own destinies.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to be protective, it’s to permit another to face reality.</p>
 <p>To let go is not to criticize, or regulate anyone, but to try to become what I dream I can do.</p>
 <p>To let go is to fear less, and to love more.</p>
